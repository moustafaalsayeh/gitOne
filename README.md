## 🚀 Project Purpose

The goal of **GitOne** is to provide a hands-on environment for practicing Git concepts, including:

- Version control basics
- Branching and merging
- Collaboration with remote repositories
- Advanced Git features like rebase, stash, and hooks

## 📚 Git Topics Covered

### 1. Git Basics
- `git init` – Initialize a new repository
- `git clone` – Clone a remote repository
- `git status` – Check current changes
- `git add` – Stage changes
- `git commit` – Save changes to local repository
- `git log` – View commit history
- `git diff` – Show changes between commits or working directory

### 2. Branching
- `git branch` – List, create, or delete branches
- `git checkout` – Switch branches or restore files
- `git switch` – Alternative command to switch branches
- `git merge` – Merge changes from one branch to another
- `git rebase` – Reapply commits on top of another branch

### 3. Remote Repositories
- `git remote` – List or add remote repositories
- `git fetch` – Fetch changes from remote without merging
- `git pull` – Fetch and merge changes from remote
- `git push` – Push commits to remote
- `git remote show <name>` – Display remote details

### 4. Undoing Changes
- `git restore <file>` – Restore file in working directory
- `git reset` – Unstage changes or reset commits
- `git revert` – Create a commit that undoes changes
- `git clean` – Remove untracked files

### 5. Advanced Topics
- `git stash` – Temporarily save changes
- `git tag` – Mark specific commits as important
- `git cherry-pick` – Apply a specific commit from another branch
- Git hooks – Automate tasks with pre-commit, post-commit scripts
- Git configurations – `git config --global user.name` etc.

### 6. Collaboration Workflows
- Forking and cloning repositories
- Pull requests / Merge requests
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Code review workflow

### 7. Git Best Practices
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep branches small and focused
- Pull before pushing to avoid conflicts
- Use `.gitignore` to avoid committing unnecessary files
- Frequently push changes to remote
